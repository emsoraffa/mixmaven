### Student Ola (us-1)
Ola tasted a new drink at a bar and wants to save it in the app so he can try to make it at home. He knows the name of the drink, the ingredients he needs and the amount of each ingredient. 

In the MixMaven app he can save this new drink to his own collection of drinks by using the *new drink* page. On that page he can create a new drink with the required ingredients, and add more information about the ingredients such as amount and alcohol percentage.

### Old man Kai (us-2)
Kai just learned how to use his computer and enjoys trying new drinks. He started using the application MixMaven to keep track of his favorite drinks. Unfortunately he often misprints and therefore writes the names of the drinks and ingredients wrong. His grandson is visiting and wants to help him fix his mistakes. 

In the MixMaven app his grandson can fix the mistakes by using the *edit* function on each drink. There he can both edit the name of the drinks and the name of the ingredients. If Kai has made other mistakes, on the amount, type or alcohol percentage, this can also be edited on the same page.

### 18 year old Sofie (us-3)
Sofie just turned 18 and is hosting a birthday party, with her closest friends, where everyone is going to make one drink each for the rest of the guests. Sofie does not know which drink she wants to make and needs inspiration. Luckily Sofie has an older sister who uses the MixMaven app to keep track of her favorite drinks. 

In the MixMaven app Sofie can browse through her sisters drinks on the *Home* page. When Sofie finds a drink she wants to make she can press on the drink to see what ingredients she needs to make the drink. She can also see the right amount of each ingredient so she knows how much she needs to buy.
