# Work Habits during Release 3

## Introduction

This document is meant to be a overview of how our work habits have been for release 3. We will go through how we have worked and reflect over what we are pleased with and what we wish we had executed better.

## Work Habits with room for improvement

### Utilising Issues as Branches

During release 3 we began creating branches based on single issues. This makes collaboration and code review easier. This should have been practiced from the start and utilized with every issue. 

### Branches/Issues becoming bigger than intended

When we faced issues where wanted to implement certain features, the branches ended up becoming far bigger and more intricate than initally anticipated. In these cases there is no clear overview. We had a few of these situations and should we have done it again we absolutely would have broken things down into smaller issues.

### Use Gitlabs review feature

We did not utilize gitlabs review feature for merge requests as much as expected. This is because we had work sessions twice a week where it proved easier to review the code and consult the person responsible for the merge request in person. However using the review feature more extensively when we did not meet could have allowed quicker turnaround in the code review process and further streamlined development.

## Work Habits we are pleased with

### Weekly Work Sessions

We continued using weekly meetings the same as in release 2. Where we would have work sessions twice a week. We found that having frequent physical work sessions allowed for better collaboration. This made it easy to share ideas and discuss important choices in the development process.

### Structure of Work Sessions

We structured our sessions after the scrum framework. First a standup meeting discussing what we did since last meeting, what is to be done moving forward and potential challenges or roadblocks. We would then create issues in gitlab and assign them amongst ourselves. This structured approach made each session productive and allowed each developer to get a better picture of the entire project.

### Pair Programming

We were also very pleased with our use of pair programming during release 3. With the implementation of both API/Server and Web application it felt natural to assign one pair on each task. Pair programming sped up problem solving and made difficult decisions less daunting. To facilitate comprehensive understanding of the project we did code reviews across pairs. We believe this also resulted in better code quality and efficiency.

### Merge Requests

We are happy with the way we continued using merge requests from release 2. We aspired to make the merge requests and commit messages clear and precise. We are also satisfied with the fact we utilised squash commits. We found reviewing previous commits to be easy and clear.
