## Drink journal (us-1)

As a user I want to store all my drinks in a kind of recipe book. Such that I can browse through all my drinks with their ingredients and amounts listed out. I also want to be able to edit drinks I want to change and delete drinks I don't want to keep.

**Important to be able to view:**

- A list of all the drinks you have added
- The ingredients of the drink, with the right amount
- Easily determine the alcohol content of a given drink

**Important to be able to do:**

- Add drinks from the list
- Remove drinks from the list
- Add any ingredient, with optional alcohol content
